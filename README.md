## Introduction

Twitter sentiment analysis is a common natural language processing task that involves determining the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in tweets. It has various applications in understanding public opinion, brand perception, and market trends.

## Data Preprocessing

Before training a machine learning model, the Twitter data undergoes several preprocessing steps to clean and transform it into a suitable format for analysis. These preprocessing steps include:

- Handling missing values
- Converting timezones
- Extracting features such as month, season, and time interval
- Lowercasing tweets and encoding labels
- Tokenizing and vectorizing text data using TF-IDF

## Model Training

A logistic regression model is trained on the preprocessed data to predict the sentiment of tweets. Logistic regression is a commonly used classification algorithm that works well for binary and multiclass classification tasks.

## Prediction

After training the model, it is used to predict the sentiment of new tweets. The trained model takes as input the TF-IDF vectorized representation of the tweets and outputs the predicted sentiment label.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn).
2. Download the Twitter dataset and the trained model.
3. Run the provided Python scripts to preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions.
